In the Macroevolution and Macroecology Lab (LabMeMe) we focus on understanding spatial and temporal patterns of biodiversity and the mechanisms responsible for generating species diversity. Our research is not limited to any specific taxonomic group but is instead motivated and organized by particular research questions. To investigate these questions we use molecular phylogenies, the fossil record, ecological data, and numerical simulation.

**Some of the topics we are interested in:**

* Investigating the possibility of a species carrying capacity (e.g. a
  limit on diversity) and what mechanisms would be responsible for
  such a potential diversity constant.
  
* Investigating the roles of speciation and extinction rates on the
  diversity dynamics.
  
* Investigating how molecular phylogenies and the fossil record can be
  used to study complex diversity dynamics.
