### Luan Motta

<p align="justify">
In his master's thesis, Luan is focusing on the Great American Biotic Interchange (GABI) to investigate how the asymmetric interchange played out at local/community spatial scale. In particular, he is testing the hypothesis that the asymmetry is also dictated by the distance to the connection between the continents.

### Salatiel Gonçalves Neto

<p align="justify">
In my masters thesis I aim to investigate if the probability of extinction in Canidae is related to the lineage’s age by delimiting adaptive zones not phylogenetically or taxonomically, but ecologically.

<p align="justify">
I’m about to start soon my masters programe and I am still trying to find my way through the
fascinating world of macroevolution. As of now, my broader interests
are: how extinction shapes biodiversity, mass extinctions aftermath
and recovery of biodiversity, how biodiversity in the sea and in land
differ, and links between micro and macroevolution.

# Undergrad Students


### Thais Piazza

<p align="justify">
Thais' undergraduate research aims to study what factors migth control the quality of the fossil record. More specifically, she will quantify how the quality of the fossil record varies among Carnivora (Mammalia) groups, investigate if fossil record quality shows phylogenetic signal, and if body size is associated with fossil record quality.

# Alumni

### [Daniel Caetano](https://caetanods.weebly.com/){:target="_blank"}

#### caetanods1@gmail.com

<p align="justify">
The central focus of my research is to understand the pattern and processes of trait evolution through long time scales using phylogenetic trees. My research is divided into development of new phylogenetic comparative models of trait evolution and empirical studies of macroevolution with multiple study systems.

<p align="justify">
Laura was a postdoctoral researcher from 2017 to 2019. She combines natural history, morphological, geographical and phylogenetic information with the application of statistical models to understand the patterns and processes shaping the radiation of vertebrates, mainly squamate reptiles. At LabMeMe, she explored the drivers of species coexistence dynamics in snakes and lizards. We also developed some ideas on how population and microevolutionary processes translate into macroevolutionary signals. She is currently a postdoctoral associate at <a href="https://marthamunoz.com/">Dr. Martha Muñoz’s lab </a> at Yale University.

<p align="justify">
My main interests are related to trait-dependent diversification
, and to how biological interactions affect the
diversification dynamics of different groups. Ohter research interests
are related to assessing the influence of total biomass availability
(with Net Primary Productivity and Biome area as proxies) on the
diversification of different groups of vertebrates, as well as trying
to understand how some groups can achieve a huge species diversity. I am also interested in
method development and performance testing. Lastly, I am an open
science enthusiast, and want to start blogging about it, general science and
my personal interests in the near future.

During my time at USP I worked in comprehending the macroevolutionary
processes that shaped diversity in deep time, with special focus on studying how interspecific competition could affect 
the diversification dynamics of Canidae (Mammalia).

My main research interest is in the ecological causes and consequences
of biological extinctions. My current research project aims to
understand macroevolutionary consequences of ecological interactions,
more specifically, the interactions between immigrant and resident
species and the role of these interactions in shaping diversification
dynamics of mammalian lineages. I am now an associate professor at UNICAMP.
