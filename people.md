My research combines natural history, morphological, geographical
and phylogenetic information with the application of statistical
models to understand the patterns and processes shaping the radiation
of reptiles and amphibians. At LabMeMe we are currently investigating
what determines the coexistence patterns among squamates at global and
large-temporal scales.

My main interests are related to trait-dependent diversification
, and to how biological interactions affect the
diversification dynamics of different groups. Ohter research interests
are related to assessing the influence of total biomass availability
(with Net Primary Productivity and Biome area as proxies) on the
diversification of different groups of vertebrates, as well as trying
to understand how some groups can achieve a huge species diversity. I am also interested in
method development and performance testing. Lastly, I am an open
science enthusiast, and want to start blogging about it, general science and
my personal interests in the near future.

I am an undergraduate student in Biology at the University of São
Paulo. I am interested in comprehending the macroevolutionary
processes that shaped diversity in deep time, with special focus on
the Equidae (Mammalia) family.

<p align="justify">
I’m an undergraduate student still trying to find my way through the
fascinating world of macroevolution. As of now, my broader interests
are: how extinction shapes biodiversity, mass extinctions aftermath
and recovery of biodiversity, how biodiversity in the sea and in land
differ, and links between micro and macroevolution.

My main research interest is in the ecological causes and consequences
of biological extinctions. My current research project aims to
understand macroevolutionary consequences of ecological interactions,
more specifically, the interactions between immigrant and resident
species and the role of these interactions in shaping diversification
dynamics of mammalian lineages. I am now an associate professor at UNICAMP.

Mauro finished his MSc. in 2015. He worked with the diversification dynamics of Placentalia, integrating data from the fossil record and from molecular phylogenies trying to identify which mammal orders are in decline of diversity. He is now a PhD. candidate at the University of British Columbia in <a href="http://mwpennell.github.io/">Dr. Matt Pennell's lab</a>.
